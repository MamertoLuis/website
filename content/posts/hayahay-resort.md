I recently returned from a trip to the town of Malitbog in Southern Leyte, where I visited my cousin Ramon Escano's mountain resort. The resort is located in a lush green valley, surrounded by mountains and waterfalls. It has a small zoo full of wild animals and farm animals, as well as comfortable cottages at reasonable prices and a swimming pool.

The resort is still under development, but Ramon has big plans for it. He intends to construct two more smaller swimming pools and function rooms for special events. I highly recommend staying at the resort or even just eating at the cantina and swimming. I guarantee you will enjoy it, and as an added bonus, the proprietor is a real character who will treat you like royalty, no matter how many family members and friends you bring with you.

Here are some of the things I enjoyed about the resort:

The beautiful scenery. The resort is located in a stunning setting, with mountains, waterfalls, and lush vegetation all around.
The friendly staff. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming, and they go out of their way to make sure you have a great time.
The comfortable cottages. The cottages are spacious and well-equipped, and they have everything you need for a relaxing stay.
The swimming pool. The swimming pool is a great place to cool off on a hot day, and it's also a great place to watch the animals in the zoo.
The small zoo. The zoo is home to a variety of animals, including monkeys, pigs, chickens, and ducks. It's a great place for kids to learn about animals.
The cantina. The cantina serves delicious food and drinks, and it's a great place to relax and enjoy the view.
Overall, I had a wonderful time at Ramon's mountain resort. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of Southern Leyte. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable travel experience.
