I am an experienced banker with a 25-year track record. Currently, I serve as the President of a Rural Bank, focusing on rural communities.

Through the years, I have honed my leadership and managerial skills, making me highly proficient in my role. I excel in tasks involving Excel spreadsheets, such as crafting reports and developing policies. Moreover, I possess an extensive understanding of computers and programming.

My educational background encompasses Economics and Law, though I haven't pursued a master's degree or passed the Bar exam.

Family-wise, I am happily married and a proud parent of two wonderful children aged 16 and 10.

My interests span a wide range, from delving into subjects like philosophy, science, and spirituality. As for leisure activities, I'm deeply engaged in programming, cultivating mushrooms, and practicing hydroponics.

Unashamedly, I identify as a Geek. My literary preferences lean towards science fiction novels, particularly the works of Isaac Asimov and the Dune series.

Looking ahead, I aspire to achieve financial independence. Ultimately, I envision embarking on global journeys with my family and undertaking solitary nature treks.
